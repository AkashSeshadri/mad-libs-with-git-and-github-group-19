Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear John,

I am writing to you from a big spaceship in a beautiful galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a red rocket in june. There are 2 cars and beaches of quicksand here! In the
hall there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
10 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
walking on a slow car!!

Best wishes,
Capt. Jack Sparrow
